This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to handling null, undefined and NaN values in conditional statements. The `bug.js` file shows the flawed code and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from the loose comparison (==) which leads to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with the special numeric value NaN. The solution adopts strict equality (===) and a more robust approach to handle various input types and cases like NaN.
